This plugin records xp gained while playing and for every 1000 total experience earned, will provide you with a "Silver Coin".

## Silver Coins
Once earnt, these can be spent on buying "packs of cards" to open on the [RuneCCG Website](https://www.runeccg.com/). Please note that there is no involvement of in-game gold, and this currency has no relation to any form of real or in-game currency. It is simply there to provide a way to open these packs.

## RuneCCG Website
